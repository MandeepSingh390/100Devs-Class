//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let array1 =  ["Demon Slayer Mugen Train", "Rush Hour", "Shawshank Remdemption"]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let var1 = array1[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let var2 = length(array1[0])
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
